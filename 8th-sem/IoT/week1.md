>IoT is interconnection of different computers and computing devices

## Why IoT

* It is envisaged to provide advanced level of services usign IoT.
* All devices connected will have some computing platforms.
* Each of these devices will act as nodes.
* And a bigger internet can be formed.

>IoT is used to make smart homes and smart cities.

* Over 9 billion 'Things' are connected to the internet as of now
* Unification of technology such as low-power embedded systems, cloud computing and big-data, machine learning and networking.

## Origin of IoT

* The 2000s is the era of ubiquity, where users and the internet will be counted in billions.
* Humans may become the minority as generators and receivers of the traffic.
* Instead most of the trafficwill flow between devices and all kinds of things, Therefore creating a much wider and more complex Interent of Things

## Enablers of IoT
* RFID
* Nanotechnology
* Sensors
* Smart Networks

## Characteristics of IoT

* Efficient, scalable and associated architecture
* Unambiguous naming and addressing
* Abundance of sleeping nodes, mobile and non-IP devices
* Intermittent connectivity

### Market Share of IoT

* 40.2% Manufacturing/Business :- For Real-time analytics of supply chains and equipment, robotic machinery
* 30.3% Healthcare :- Portable health monitoring, electronic record keeping, pharmaceutical safegaurd
* 8.3% Retail :- Inventory tracking, smartphone purchasing, anonymous analytics of consumer choices
* 7.7% Security :- Biometric and facial recognition locks, remote sensors

### Evolution of Connected Devices

ATMs -> Web -> Meters -> Digital locks -> Hospitals -> Vehicles -> Cities -> Dust

## Baseline Connectivity Technologies

>There are number of technologies that are closely related to IoT.

1. Machine-to-Machine communications (M2M)
2. Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS)
3. Web-of-Things (WoT)

### IoT vs M2M

* M2M refers to interactions between machines and devices
* Interactions via cloud infra
* M2M offers means for managing devices and device interactions while also collecting machine or sensor data.
* M2M is a term introduced by telecom service providers.

>M2M is a part of IoT

* IoT has a broader scope than M2M, since it comprises of broader range of interactions between devices.
* It also enables the composition of workflows comprising of all of the above interactions. (devices, human and applications)
* IoT includes the notion of internet connectivity, but is not necessarily focused on the use of telecom networks.

### IoT vs WoT

* WoT enables access and control over IoT resources and applications using mainstream web technologies (HTML, JS, AJAX etc).
* Therefore, WoT is based in RESTFUL principles and REST APIs, Which enable both developer and deployers to benefit from the popularity and maturity of web trechnologies.
