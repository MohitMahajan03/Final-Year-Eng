# Introduction to Ethical Hacking

> What is Ethical Hacking?

* It refers to the act of locating weaknesses and vulnerabilities of computer and information systems _by replicating the intent and actions of malicious hackers._

* This is also known as _penetration testing_, _intrusion testing_ or _red teaming._

>Penetration Test
* Legal attempt to break into the comapny's network to find the weak links.
* Tester only report findings, does not provide solutions.

>Security Test
* Also includes analyzing company's security policy and procedures.
* Tester offers solutions to secure or protect the network.

## Basic Terminologies

* **Hacking**: Showing computer expertise.
* **Cracking**: Breaching the security on software or systems.
* **Spoofing**: Faking the originating IP address in a datagram.
* **Denial of Service**: Flooding a host with sufficient network traffic so that it cannot respond anymore.
* **Port Scanning**: Searching for vulnerabilities (from open ports).

## Gaining Access

* Front door:
    * Password Guessing
    * Password/key stealing

* Back doors:
    * Often left (open) by original develoopers as debug and/or diagnostic tools.

* Trojan Horses
    * Usually hidden inside of software that we download and install from the net.
    * Many install backdoors

* Software vulnerability exploitation
    * Often advertised on the OEMs website along with security patches.
    * Fertile ground for script kiddies (noobs) looking for something to do.

## What the hacker can do...

* Modify logs
    * cover all their tracks
* Steal files
* Modify files
* Install backdoors
* Attack other systems

## Penetration testing methodologies

* Tiger Box
    * Collection of OSs and hacking tools.
    * Usually on a laptop
    * Helpts penetration testes and security tester to conduct vulnerabilities assessments and attacks.

* White box model
    * Tester is told everything about the network topology and technology.
    * Tester is authorized to interview IT personnel and company employees.
    * Makes tester's job a little easier.

* Black box model
    * Tester is not given details about the network.
    * Burden is on the tester to find the details.

* Gray box model
    * Hybrid of the white and black box models.
    * Company gives tester partial information.
